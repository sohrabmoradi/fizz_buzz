Fizz buzz is a group word game for children to teach them about division.[1] Players take turns to count incrementally, replacing any number 
divisible by three with the word "fizz", and any number divisible by five with the word "buzz", and any number divisible by both 3 and 5 with 
the word "fizzbuzz".

Assignment
Fizz Buzz - write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number 
and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz” (Fizz buzz, 2023).
